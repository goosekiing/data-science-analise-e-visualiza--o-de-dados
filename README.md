# Data Science: Analysis and Visualization of Data

This repository contains a project that demonstrates data analysis and visualization using the Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries. The project uses data from a .csv file of sales from a fictional company. The data is organized and filtered to create the proposed visualizations and styled tables.

## Project Overview
The project aims to explore and visualize sales data using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques and creating visualizations to present the information clearly and stylishly.

## Training Details
This project is part of the "Data Science" track from Alura. For more information about the track, visit [Alura](https://cursos.alura.com.br/formacao-data-science-v377549).

## Objectives Achieved
- Explore data with exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Understand the types of variables
- Learn the role of visualizations such as histograms and boxplots
- Understand the importance of visualizations and take the first steps in creating them
- Use summary measures
- Explore data in Python with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
